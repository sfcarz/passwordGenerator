This Homework was spicier than the first. I enjoy challenges and as student beginning to understand JavaScript, i feel accomplished.
Although, i have a long way to go. 

I decided to go with my own design for the body instead of using the normal look the homework had by default. I used bootstrap. I must admit, the more i play with bootstrap, the more I learn and the more I like. It makes my life easier for styling purposes. 

In this assignment, I learned what splitting a string does, creates it into an array. From there, I also learned .concat which adds an array to another array. 
Finally, randomizing strings, which included numbers, letters, and symbols and creating a function to output a random amount selected by the user. 
This was fun, i had the structure correct, I just didn't add the amount i needed properly. Thank you TA's, shout out to Kit for putting up with Me. 
Last bit was getting the value out of a function and for that I used BCS, and it was as easy as adding return and what ever i stored my value in within the parantheses. 


I wish I had more one on one with tutors.
